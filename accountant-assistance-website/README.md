# Accountant Assistant – Frontend Interface

## 💡 Project Overview

This is the **frontend interface** of an intelligent **Accountant Website** where users can:

- 💬 **Input any message** (e.g., "How much did I spend on food last week?")
- 📊 Automatically get details about their expenses
- ➕ Add new expenses by simply sending a **single natural language message**
- 🧠 Get smart summaries, categorized expense reports, and real-time financial tracking

This project is focused on **simplicity** and **automation**, so you don’t need to use a complex dashboard. Just talk to your accountant assistant – it handles the rest.

## 🧠 Backend Automation

We’ve integrated **n8n** with **Google Sheets** to:

- ✅ Store all user expense data automatically
- 📂 Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Travel, Electronics)
- 🔎 Fetch insights from past data using AI (Gemini/GPT)

The system intelligently interprets your messages using a Text Classifier and routes the data through Google Sheets for persistent storage and quick access.
